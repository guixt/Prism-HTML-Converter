# **HTML Code Formatter for PrismJS**

### **Overview**
We created this tool to efficiently format and highlight code snippets on our website. Our documentation contains many code examples, including **GuiXT**, **ABAP**, and other languages that are not well-supported by existing syntax highlighters. To ensure consistent and readable formatting, we use **PrismJS** for syntax highlighting and needed a way to semi-automate the conversion of code within HTML files.

This tool allows you to **select code in an HTML preview and automatically convert it into properly formatted PrismJS syntax** with line numbers and copy buttons.

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Features**
âœ” **Live HTML Preview** â€“ Select code directly in the integrated **WebView2 browser**  
âœ” **PrismJS Integration** â€“ Converts selected code into **PrismJS-compatible HTML**  
âœ” **Supports Multiple Languages** â€“ Works with **GuiXT, ABAP, JavaScript, HTML, and VB.NET**  
âœ” **Backup & Restore** â€“ Automatically creates backups before modifications  
âœ” **File Management** â€“ Move processed files to a "done" folder, restore previous versions, and delete files  
âœ” **Keyboard Shortcuts** â€“ Fast editing with configurable hotkeys

## **ðŸš€ How It Works**
1. **Select an HTML file** from the file list  
2. **Highlight a code section** in the preview window  
3. Click **"Replace Code"** to format the selection with **PrismJS syntax**  
4. **Save & manage files** â€“ move completed files, restore backups, or delete unwanted content  

If a placeholder (`<div name="prism_placeholder"></div>`) exists, it can be replaced with formatted code from a text input.
